    People can encapsulate intimate memories, emotional phrases, and posts that had to be removed into barcode stickers, concealing them in the tapestry of everyday life. Through this project, we aim to evade the "textual prison" imposed in the digital age. We hope that one day, people may chance upon these stickers and discover the profound significance of the phrases for that particular 'someone,' thereby imbuing the cold barcodes with the warmth of emotions and enriching their value and meaning.

  <p>
    The artificial earthquake refers to seismic events caused by human activities rather than natural occurrences. As the human population increases, unintentional artificial earthquakes also begin to be created, with even the simple act of human movement contributing inadvertently. Our feet on the ground and paces will generate extremely small vibrations and noises with each step, which gradually alters the frequency of the earth, leaving traces behind when vibrations accumulate.

    Dodder, a plant that thrives in Taiwan, was first documented in ‘Shennong Bencaojing.’<br>Dodder cannot photosynthesize or absorb water from the soil. To survive, it parasitizes other plants, using unique suction structures to penetrate the host to gain nutrients, causing the plant to wither.<br>To reduce the population of Dodder and utilize it, we have genetically modified its genes to humans , allowing a more direct way to parasite and consume nutrients from plants.

  <p>
    When humans, as carbon-based beings, reached out with tool-making hands, technology began to invade us, and the boundaries of human individuality expanded with technological development. In today's society, the internet and information have become extensions of humanity. As M. McLuhan said, the relationship between humans and objects has been expanded, but human consciousness remains confined within the physical body, thus highlighting loneliness.<br>In this era of information explosion, have humans found a balance to coexist with technology? Has the truth and salvation of life been realized through technological development? Or are we still blindly following incorrect information while being misunderstood?<br>In a time filled with information noise, how can we live truly and clearly? This struggling state of existence is what we aim to express through our artworks.<br>

    Wei-San CHIANG and Yi-Yen CHEN utilize visual media for storytelling, employing art as a universal language that bridges humans, technology, and space. Their work examines interpersonal distances in contemporary environments, explores the emotional connections between the virtual and real, and incorporates their own presence into their creations.<br>

    Representing an oasis filled with freedom. Here, we find the Technology has gradually stripped away human rights, confining humanity to a cage devoid of privacy, surrounded by invisible jailers and watched by billions of eyes. People become naked prisoners under the shadow of technology. Private sanctuaries offer hope and respite, with each marker on the map paradise beyond.
